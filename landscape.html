		<p>These are the landscape photos I took during my trip to Florida. When I saw the beautiful scenery,
			I was so immersed in the beautiful atmosphere that I recorded these moments with photos.I wish
			I could record my feelings in different places in this way. Maybe in the future when I see these photos,
			I can recall the feeling at that time. Photos can't keep time, but they can help us freeze the moment.</p>

		<p>The first half of these photos come from a trip I went to Miami Beach on Christmas 2021.
			I recorded the sunset by the sea. The second half of these photos are from my trip to Sichuan,
			China, in the summer of 2021. I hope I can go to more places and record different scenery in the future.</p>

		<p>Another hobby of mine is traveling, I hope I can have more time in the future, take pictures while
			traveling, and travel to more places. The world is like a book to me, and the more places we travel,
			the more deeply we read and experience the book. I can also use the way of travel, learn more about the
			world.</p>
